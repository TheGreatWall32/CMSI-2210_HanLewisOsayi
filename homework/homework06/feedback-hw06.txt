   possible maximum of 118%

========================================================

   you earned 69.00/82.00 which is 84.15% plus
   18 extra credit points which is 102.15% which is an A-plus

========================================================
SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:
   Although you did it in some of your code, you didn't put a file header
      into every source code file as was specified several times in class,
      which contained the commands you used to build the programs.  As I
      said previously, this is VERY HELPFUL when someone else is going to
      build and run your code.  I did the best I could with the source
      files that neglected this requirement, so there may be some points
      deducted for things that I had to modify to get your code to work.

problem 1 findGCD.nasm
   works as advertised

problem 2 findGCDfunc.nasm & gcdFinder.c
   works as advertised

problem 3 paritygen.nasm
   not done

problem 4 whichEndIsUp.c
   works as advertised

problem 5 makeNBOC.c & makeNBOCtest.c
   works as advertised

problem 6 makeNBOC.c & makeNBON.nasm
   works as advertised, although the "link" command requires some special
      handling since windows 10 doesn't have that as a native application.

========================================================
SEMESTER HOMEWORK TOTALS:

   Homework01  100.00% of  5 points =  5.00 points
   Homework02   95.00% of  5 points =  4.75 points
   Homework03   76.32% of  5 points =  3.82 points
   Homework04   98.88% of  5 points =  4.94 points

Great work!  It's been wonderful having you three in class this semester!
Best wishes for a great holiday break and I look forward to seeing you all
around campus in the spring!
