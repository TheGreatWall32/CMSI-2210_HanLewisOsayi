SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

Nice work here, looks like everything is working for you.

Excellent that you attempted the assembly code right out of the gate!  I'm
assuming that it is for an x86-type processoron a windows machine?  I was
able to build and run the code on my x86 box in 32-bit mode by using the
command "nasm -f win32 sayhello.nasm" then linking using the command
"gcc sayhello.obj".  It ran for me just fine.

It is helpful when doing assembly code to put a small comment header at the
top of the file which states the commands used to assemble and link so that
other team mates and maintainers know what to do.  Try to make that a habit.

As a challenge to yourselves in your "C" code, see if you can find another
   way of reading values from the user.  There are several different ways
   of doing that, so do a little research to see what else is available.

Off to a great start!
