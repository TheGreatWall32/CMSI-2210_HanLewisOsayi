1) What is a computer system?
  Something that follows the Von Neumann architecture for a computer.

2) What are some of the parts of a computer system?
  input/output devices, circuits, gates, microcode, operating system, assembly code.

3) What is the difference between a compiled language and an intepreted language?
  Compiled languages translate the code into machine code all at once so that you can run it, interpreted languages convert while running.

4) Is C a compiled language?
  Yes.

5) Who invented the C language?
  Ritchie.

6) How long has C been in use?
  Since the 1970s.

7) Is a compiler a translator?
  Yes.

8) Is an assembler a translator?
  Yes.

9) What is the command to list out the contents of a directory on a mac terminal window?
  ls.

10) What does the C function atof() do?
  Turns a string into a float (double).

11) What are the bottom two layers of a computer system? Give a brief desciption of each.
  0) Digital logic: the physical computer hardware.
  1) Control: the microcode that uses that hardware.

12) What are the three steps of the Von Neumann Architecture?
  1) control unit fetches the next instruction, stores the address in the program counter (internal register).
  2) fetched instruction is decoded.
  3) ALU executes the instruction.

13) What is the purpose of an ALU?
  It performs all the math and bitwise operations for the cpu.

14) What is a register?
  Memory local to the cpu, that is faster than main memory, used to hold information while the cpu is performing operations.

15) What is one difference between Application software and System software?
  Application sofware is written for people to use, systems software is written for the computer.

16) Is the phrase cmp rdi, rsi machine language?
  Yes

17) How many buses are included in the system bus?
  3.

18) What is the decimal value of 10010111?
  151.

19) What is the decimal value of 11111111?
  255.

20) What is the largest unsigned integer value that will fit into 16 bits?
  65,535 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/65,535)
