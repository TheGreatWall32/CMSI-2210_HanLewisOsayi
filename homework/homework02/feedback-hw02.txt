SPECIFIC COMMENTS/FEEDBACK:

problem 1, your answer is a bit simplistic.  A computer system is more than
   the Von Neumann architecture.  Think of the Internet as a giant computer
   and you'll see what I mean.

problem 2, "assembly code" isn't really a *part* of the computer system, but
   is one of the layers that contributes to the computer's operation.  Still
   your answer is close enough.

problem 8, don't forget that people can write assembly code, too ~ it doesn't
   HAVE to be the output from a compiler!

problem 9, don't forget that there are LOTS of options you can use with the
   "ls" command to get more information and/or format the output!

problem 12, the answer "fetch, decode, execute" is all that was needed.  The
   fetch cycle doesn't store the address in the program counter, it actually
   uses the address in the program counter to get the next instruction from
   memory.

problem 17, "cmp rdi, rsi" is NOT machine language, it is assembly code.  The
   machine language is ALWAYS only ones and zeros.

Nice job!
